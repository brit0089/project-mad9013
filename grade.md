## Comments

### HTML
Search for `prof feedback` in individual files for specific comments.

### CSS
Use of classes like `.h3-style` and `.h2-style` feels redundant and extra work. You have to apply it to all headings in the blog content. It would be easier to apply the same styles to `.article-content h2` nad `.article-content h3` then you don't need to put the class on every element.

### Responsive Design
Overall great! A few issues:
- The two column grid for the content/sidebar on the blog page is too wide. You should limit the two columns to the width of the `.container`

### Assignment Requirements
- Colour scheme should have been changed from in-class colours
- CSS Variables should be used for applying colours.
